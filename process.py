def log_transaction(transaction_type, date, stock, number_of_shares, price, fees, ledger_file):
    '''
    Record a transaction in the file ledger_file. If the file doesn't exist, create it.
    
    Input:
        transaction_type (str): 'buy' or 'sell'
        date (int): the date of the transaction (nb of days since day 0)
        stock (int): the stock we buy or sell (the column index in the data array)
        number_of_shares (int): the number of shares bought or sold
        price (float): the price of a share at the time of the transaction

    Output: returns None.
        Writes one line in the ledger file to record a transaction with the input information.
        This should also include the total amount of money spent (negative) or earned (positive)
        in the transaction, including fees, at the end of the line.
        All amounts should be reported with 2 decimal digits.

    Example:
        Log a purchase of 10 shares for stock number 2, on day 5. Share price is 100, fees are 50.
        Writes the following line in 'ledger.txt':
        buy,5,2,10,100.00,-1050.00
